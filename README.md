## My process

It took me a while to finish this project. 
I understood many things from Js thanks to this challenge, so the hard work paid off. 
I  think i still have a lot to work on in the sintax matter as well on how fast i can solve a code issue. 
I'm happy with the result tho, I think i always say the same after finishing every project but i do feel like i've improved a lot since the first challenge i did, so i'm proud of my little trajetory so far. :D
